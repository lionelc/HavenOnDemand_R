Title: HPE HavenOnDemand for R
Version: 0.1.0.0000
Authors@R: person("Lei", "Jiang", email = "lionelchange@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This is the wrapper for R users who have interest in using HPE Haven OnDemand APIs. It provides a straightforward way for calling the APIs directly from R. The connection between your R client and HPE server side is via POST connections. Once you create a HODClient with your apikey, you can call the corresponding API using postHODSync() or postHODAsync(). It also includes i) text index operations: create, add_text_to, and delete text indexes; and ii) some local operations that help you on track with your indexes and HavenOnDemand jobs (especially the async ones). Please refer to the github page for step-by-step usage. 
Depends: R (>= 3.0.0), RCurl, jsonlite
